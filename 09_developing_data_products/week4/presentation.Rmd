# Week 4 - Assignment

Data Analysis of the largest national exam for High School education in Brazil

 - ENEM - Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio
 
# The Analysis

## What is ENEM ?

[ENEM](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Exame_Nacional_do_Ensino_M%C3%A9dio) is a non-mandatory, standardized Brazilian national exam, which evaluates high school students in Brazil.

## The data

I processed the 2019 data provided by the organization of the exam.

The original data was too large for an web app with <code><= 2GB</code> RAM memory

Therefore, I filtered only those students who had a score high enough to pass in Computer Science at [University of São Paulo (USP)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/University_of_S%C3%A3o_Paulo).
